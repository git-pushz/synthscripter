In the ever-changing tides of the software industry, it's not just about riding the wave; it's about navigating it with a compass that points towards simplicity and adaptability. This week's edition of Byte Trends dives deep into these currents, exploring how software engineering practices have evolved. We seek clarity in code, adapt to new tools, and evolve with emerging best practices to remain buoyant in the digital ocean.

Our journey today, dear readers, brings us the simplicity of clear code, the sunset of outdated technologies, a reshaping of long-established practices, and navigating the bustling ports of Docker. So buckle up, as we set sail through the rough waters of technical best practices, making sense of the cargo of information that has been loaded onto our decks.

## Written in Clarity: The Pursuit of Simplicity in Code

No sailor loves to navigate the fog, and no engineer loves to decipher clever but cryptic code. [Clever code is probably the worst code you could write](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/clever-code-is-probably-the-worst), as it embodies a paradox: it's the offspring of skilled minds yet the nemesis of maintainability. Have we not all, like Blaise Pascal once lamented, written lengthy code not because we thirst for verbosity, but simply because we haven't found the simplicity on the other side of complexity?

> &gt; Je n’ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.
> As Blaise Pascal said. (often miss-attributed to Twain as “I apologize for such a long letter - I didn't have time to write a short one.") — [fragglerock](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17zl7oc/clever_code_is_probably_the_worst_code_you_could/ka04er7/)

What emerges from the mist is a collective agreement on social craftsmanship, as [Writing good code is a social skill](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17zl7oc/clever_code_is_probably_the_worst_code_you_could/ka03kro/). It's a reminder that our work, like that of a skilled cartographer, is to craft maps that others can navigate, long after we have set foot on new shores.

## Out with the Old, In with the Modern: Embracing Change in Tools

On these winds of change, we've seen sunsets on the horizon for familiar tools. With the deprecation of Manifest V2, Chrome's sailor's almanac on extensions, we're reminded that evolution is inevitable. The [Manifest V2 extensions are going to be disabled starting June 2024](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/), and this change has stirred the waters, with some ready to jump ship to other browsers like Firefox, and others reluctantly hoisting new sails for a different course.

The community's comments echo a greater sentiment: the yearning for control over the tools that shape their digital world, an innate desire not to be adrift on a sea dictated by giants.

## Aligning with Universal Time: Python's Declarative Tides

Every seasoned navigator knows the importance of the stars, and in programming, our stars align with clear, predictable timing functions. With Python deprecating [datetime.utcnow()](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/it-s-time-for-a-change-datetime-utcnow-is-now-deprecated), sailors of Python are nudged toward 'aware' datetimes—a change that prioritizes precision, clarity, and eliminates the ambiguity of 'naive' timestamps.

> It’s deprecated starting DateTime.Now() — [iPlayTehGames](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17ypuzh/its_time_for_a_change_datetimeutcnow_is_now/k9vb5xy/)

It's a nautical adjustment on the part of Python's decision-makers, ensuring the ships of code sail true, avoiding the rocky shores of timing-related bugs and inconsistencies.

## The Trusty Port of Docker: Stepping Aboard with Confidence

As we navigate through choppy waters, the safe harbor of [Docker](https://devopscycle.com/blog/the-ultimate-docker-cheat-sheet/) shines like a lighthouse for those adrift on the vast ocean of deployment complexity. Yet, many a brave soul still faces the storm of confusion that Docker commands can bring. Here, a cheat sheet serves not only as a map for the uninitiated but also as the beginning of a greater understanding of the technology.

> It’s a great intro but you left one big element behind: docker compose. Docker compose is essential to running multiple containers without an orchestrator like k8s, and there are many advantages of wrapping even a single container in a composer yml. — [tonyp7](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1815172/do_you_have_a_hard_time_understanding_docker/kaajeb2/)

Docker isn't just a liferaft—it's an entire fleet, allowing us to package, ship, and run our applications regardless of the turbulent seas of differing environments.

## Conclusion: Charting the Course for a Progressive Voyage

Throughout our exploration, it's clear that simplicity isn't just an aesthetic choice—it's a guiding principle that allows us to scale, adapt, and create code that stands the test of time. With each sunset of outdated practices, we welcome the sunrise that brings new tools and adaptable methodologies into our sights. We've learned that code should be a tale that tells itself without the need for cryptographic deciphering, that Python's step towards clarity aligns us with universality, and that Docker is no mere trend—it's shaping up to be a legacy.
   
Just as the stars guide the ship at night, may these insights guide your code during the day. Let's hoist our sails for simplicity, embrace modern tools, and remain open to the winds of change. Until our next issue, may your code be clean and your deployments smooth.

— Your humble navigator of the digital seas, *Byte Trends*.
