## Dark Days Ahead: The EU's Evasive Maneuvers in Web Security

The European Union stands on the verge of a regulatory leap that could turn back the clocks to a less secure web era – a move that could greatly compromise internet users' privacy. A proposed regulation, eIDAS 2.0, includes an incendiary article that essentially revives the specter of widespread government surveillance reminiscent of the days when certificate authorities were easily manipulated.

### The Return of Compliance Over Security

At the heart of this debate is Article 45, which, if passed, would place government-appointed certificate authorities beyond the stringent security checks modern browsers enforce. This stipulation means that these CAs could be used to intercept HTTPS communications not just within the EU, but potentially globally, undermining trust in secure messaging.

- **Comments Spotlight:**
    > "So what happened? It still faces final ratification, but it doesn't seem there is much resistance." — [P3w7Mh](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/article-45-will-roll-back-web-security-12-years)
    
    > "This is why I have a love/hate relationship with the European Union tech regulations, they make great decisions like USB-C or privacy and on the other side, they make some nonsense choices." — [cfouche](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/article-45-will-roll-back-web-security-12-years)

The EU's decision has ignited a firestorm of controversy within the tech community, fearfully speculating the repercussions of creating two versions of browsers – one less secure variant for the EU. This regression could not only stifle competition in the browser market but also weaken the advocacy for increased security that has, until now, been a cornerstone of the EU's digital identity.

## The Ticking Time of Unix: A Reminder of Digital Ephemeralness

A milestone in Unix time, which underpins many systems' timekeeping, has recently been reached. The significance, while technical, serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of technology and the quirks inherent in the frameworks we depend on daily.

### The Digital Epoch and its Ingenious Quirks

- **Community Insights:**
    > "Another hundred million closer to Y2.038K, which is the real fun-filled party I am looking forward to." — [ceci][https://www.epochconverter.com/countdown?q=1700000000]

Unix time, now at 1,700,000,000 seconds since its epoch start, marks a palpable step towards an event known as the Year 2038 problem. In layman's terms, this is when systems that track time as a 32-bit integer will experience a rollover, potentially leading to errors and software failures. It's these curiosities that remind us technology, while solid, has an expiration date engineered into its very DNA.

## A Costly Line: How a Small Mistake Crippled AT&T's Network

AT&T's harrowing financial setback in 1990, where a single misplaced line of code caused network failure for hours, stands as a testament to the fragile nature of even the most fortified systems and the ensuing chaos even minor errors can churn.

### The Danger Hidden in Every Line of Code

The incident at AT&T provides a notable lesson in attentiveness and the necessity of comprehensive procedural safeguards. 

- **Reddit Response:**
    > "This is one of the most challenging for people to understand in Software development: there is a huge difference between the cause of an incident and let's call this 'the trigger'." — [dlevac](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-one-line-of-code-caused-a-60)

The dialogue unleashed within tech circles sharply critiques the company's decision to bypass testing for what they deemed a negligible change, raising the bar for the importance of diligent oversight and thorough procedures in the software world.

## High-Stakes Coding: The Lucrative Language Leaderboard

DevJobsScanner's insightful scrape of over 10M programming job offers reveals which programming languages wield the mightiest paychecks. From Java to Solidity, the study paints an evolving picture of demand and value in the programming job market.

### The Languages That Pay Your Bills

- **Reddit Reactions:**
    > "From your data, most of the 'highest paid' languages also have the least jobs associated to them. Common sense should lead most people to aim for those that balance high salary with equally high job availability." — [Service-Kitchen](https://www.devjobsscanner.com/blog/top-10-highest-paid-programming-languages/)

Interestingly, it's the specialized, industry-specific languages that seem to offer the highest salaries, highlighting the value of niche expertise. However, the community urges a more balanced approach considering both remuneration and job availability in career decisions.

## A Glimpse Under the Hood: The Story of Git

An intriguing look into the creation of Git by Linus Torvalds offers more than a peek at the lore surrounding this groundbreaking tool. It's a yarn spun with conflict, innovation, and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it development timeline.

### The Accidental Genesis of a Developer Staple

- **Thoughts from the Community:**
    > "Actually the history was just modified to make it look that way ;-)" — [kbielefe](https://graphite.dev/blog/understanding-git)

Born out of necessity and a bit of spite, Git's inception story reflects both the personal drive of a frustrated developer and the lightning-fast pace at which solutions can rise in the tech landscape.

## Stack Overflow: From Tech Shrine to Ghost Library?

The downward trajectory of Stack Overflow's influence has industry veterans and novices alike pondering the fate of what was once the beating heart of the developer community's knowledge-sharing landscape.

### Where Did the Curators of Code Go?

- **A Community’s Concern:**
    > "I think the real problem with SO is all the great contributors have moved on. Now if you ask a question it's more than likely to either be arbitrarily downvoted to hell or you just get made fun of for not knowing. It's become a toxic learning Q/A board and imo no longer worth logging in to." — [No-Replacement-3501](https://observablehq.com/@ayhanfuat/the-fall-of-stack-overflow)

Although opinions are divided regarding the platform's current state and future, it's clear that Stack Overflow's potential demise could signify more than just the loss of a question-and-answer site. 

## FAQs: Diving Deeper into November's Tech Currents
